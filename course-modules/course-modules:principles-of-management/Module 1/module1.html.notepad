In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of management and leadership, covering topics such as the four main functions of management, the evolution of management thought, and the impact of love and culture on organizational strategy. The readings from <em>Contemporary Management<\/em> (Chapters 1 and 2) and <em>Love as a Business Strategy<\/em> (Chapters 1 and 2) will provide a solid foundation for understanding these key concepts.<\/p>\n    <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">As you progress through the module, consider how the principles of management and leadership apply to your own experiences, whether in work, school, or personal life. Reflect on the managers and leaders you have encountered and how their approaches align with the theories and concepts presented.<\/p>\n    <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><em>Need Support?

First, the classical management theories that emerged around the turn of the twentieth century are examined. Next, behavioral management theories developed before and after World War II are examined, and then management science theory, which developed during the second World War. Finally, the theories developed to help explain how the external environment affects how organizations and managers operate are examined.<\/li>\n                        <\/ul>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/details>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/li>\n        <li>\n            <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><strong>Love as a Business Strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n            <ul class=\"list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 -mt-1\">\n                <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Chapter 1: What Is Love?

What Is Love? (Baby Don't Hurt Me).<\/strong> In November 2015, Softway had its darkest day. Confronted with an unexpected downturn and desperate to keep his company afloat, CEO Mohammad Anwar agreed to lay off over a third of Softway's workforce&mdash;around a hundred employees in all. This grim reality, coupled with the dehumanizing process of letting these team members go and the very real prospect that Mohammad might lose his company anyway, shook Mohammad to his core and led to a prolonged period of soul-searching. It was in this introspective-yet-brooding mood that Mohammad found himself at a University of Houston football game with his brother a few weeks after the massive layoffs at Softway. What he discovered at this game was that love does matter.<\/li>\n                            <li><strong>Chapter 2. Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast.<\/strong> To make a point on worker responsibility, Mohammad sent a toxic email to his employees that shook them to their core. Glassdoor reviews have stated, \"The upper management is completely unprofessional. Expect to be ridiculed, yelled at, or cursed. You can also look forward to petty emails about the condition of the refrigerator with demands that you meet to clean it (which you may not even use)... If you see any good reviews, you can assume they're written by HR!\" This was a difficult lesson Mohammad learned, that culture eats strategy for breakfast. He had a lot of change in front of him.<\/li>\n                        <\/ul>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/details>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n    <h4><strong>Multimedia<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/3sK3wJAxGfs?feature=shared\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Navy Seal Admiral - If You Want to Change the World, Make Your Bed<\/a> [6:00 minutes]<\/li>\n        <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe?utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Good Leaders Make You Feel Safe<\/a> [11:46 minutes]<\/li>\n        <li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/stanley_mcchrystal_listen_learn_then_lead?utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stanley McChrystal: Listen, Learn, Then Lead<\/a> [15:22 minutes]<\/li>\n    <\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; text-align: center; margin-top: 10px;\">\n    <div class=\"\" style=\"background-color: #e45424; font-size: 14pt; margin: auto; padding: 10px; width: 5%;\"><img id=\"901586\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https:\/\/heidelberg.instructure.com\/courses\/15770\/files\/909539\/preview\" alt=\"\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" data-api-endpoint=\"https:\/\/heidelberg.instructure.com\/api\/v1\/courses\/15770\/files\/909539\" data-api-returntype=\"File\" \/><\/div>\n    <h3 style=\"background-color: #eef4f9; font-size: 12pt; margin: auto; padding: 10px; width: 95%; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Tasks to Complete or Submit<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-box\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; background-color: #f7f7f7; padding: 1.5% 2.5%;\">\n    <p><em>Completing the following tasks and assignments is crucial for demonstrating your understanding, applying your knowledge, and engaging with your peers and instructor.<\/em><\/p>\n    <h4 class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap\"><span>📚 <\/span><strong>Engage with Course Content<\/strong><\/h4>\n    <p>Read the assigned chapters from Contemporary Management and Love as a Business Strategy to build a strong foundation in management and leadership principles.
