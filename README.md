- **Learner-Centered**: Focusing on the needs and goals of the learners.
- **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in research and best practices in education.
- **Innovative**: Utilizing the latest technologies and methodologies to enhance learning.
- **Inclusive**: Ensuring that all learners, regardless of background, have the opportunity to succeed.
